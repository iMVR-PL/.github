### 🧬 About the Joint Lab
The **IMVR & PuzzleLogic Joint Lab** bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI research and real-world clinical pathology. Our mission is to develop robust, scalable, and interpretable AI solutions for high-resolution medical imaging and surgical robotics.

* **Intelligent Medical Vision (iMVR):** Focusing on 3D/4D medical scene understanding, cross-modality learning, and surgical robot perception.
* **Computational Pathology (PuzzleLogic):** Specializing in Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) analysis, Foundation Models for pathology, and efficient diagnostic workflows.

### 🔬 Core Research & Development
Our work focuses on three primary pillars of innovation:

1.  **Foundation Models for Healthcare:** Developing large-scale pre-trained models for pathology and medical vision.
2.  **Surgical Data Science:** Enhancing robot-assisted surgery through real-time perception and 3D reconstruction.
3.  **Scalable Clinical AI:** Building high-throughput pipelines for digital pathology in collaboration with top-tier hospitals.
