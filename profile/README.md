### 🧬 About Us
The **IMVR & PuzzleLogic Research Collaboration** integrates advanced AI research with clinical practice to address the multi-scale, high-dimensional complexity of digital pathology. Our mission is to move computational pathology beyond isolated pattern recognition toward models that internalize the expert "thoughts" and structured reasoning pathways used by human specialists.


---

### 🔬 Core Research & Development
Our work focuses on four primary pillars of innovation:

* **Regional to Slide Interpretation:** Efficient gigapixel-scale Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis through MIL Models and ROI evidences.
* **Spatial Interpretation:** Bridging morphology with spatial transcriptomics via generative frameworks.
* **Pathological VLM Reasoning:** Focusing on multi-scale diagnostic reasoning and evidence flow, mimicking how pathologists navigate from low-power tissue architecture to high-power cellular details.
* **Pathological Agentic System:** Agentic system for close-circus evidence seeking and human-ai-collaboration.
